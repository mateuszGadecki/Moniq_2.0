# MoniQ 2.0

This is the second improved version of this [page](https://github.com/mateuszGadecki/MoniQ). This page was created at the beginning of my Javascript learning.
I added some functionalities thanks to using javascript.
This is a very basic code, but in my opinion, going back to this project, you can see the progress that I was able to make.
All page elements are not finished because I abandoned this project.
